*Continuous Integration. Continuous Improvement.*


ScaRC (Scalable Recursive Clustering) is intended as an alternative pressure solver for the Fire Dynamics Simulator ([FDS](https://github.com/firemodels/fds)) and is still in beta development. For more information on FDS, including a link to the associated discussion forum, please visit the [FDS-SMV website](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/).
